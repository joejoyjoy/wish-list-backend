# Requirements for the backend server using express to manage a to-do list. ðŸ“š

## Introduction ðŸ’¡

The system will consist of a backend server that will use the express framework to implement a RESTful API that allows users to create, query, modify, and delete tasks. The system will communicate with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve task information.
